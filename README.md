# COMES Group

Like, what _is_ COMES Group anyways?

---

COMES Group is a fictional """""""company""""""" [based in Opole](https://bellard.org/textsynth/), Poland. It's a gag between me (@[liquidev](https://github.com/liquidev/)) and my friends. We make products that are intentionally flawed in some way, shape, or form.

The company is as generic as it gets – the name follows the typical Polish firm naming scheme, where you pick a word and append one of the following:
- `ex` will make you look professional and international
- `es` is a lesser-used variation of `ex` and doesn't work with as many words
- `-Pol` will make you look local
- `-Mar` will make you look trustworthy.

<sup>Of course I'm just making these meanings up as I write this, but hey, at least this way it's a little more fun than just "the stereotypical Polish company naming scheme".</sup>

The logo is just the word "COMES" with a swoosh – as bland and done-to-death of a design as it gets.

The goal is to write software that looks fine on the outside but is broken on the inside, or looks bad on the outside and is okay on the inside, or both. Everyone gets to pick their poison.  
Good, usable software no place in this organization. Put it on your profile instead, it's worthy of better reputation.

Since this is just a bunch of long-time friends having some fun together, we do not accept new people here, so don't ask for an invite.
